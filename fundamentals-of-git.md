# Fundamentals of Git

## What is Git?

Git is a [version control system](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control) first created by Linus Torvalds with the aim of managing software changes over time. It is not the first version control system (SVN and Mercurial existed before it) but it is one of the most commonly used ones.

At a high level, version control systems track the "history of changes" of a piece of software over time. Git, in particular, emphasizes the use of a decentralized collaborative workflow, allowing teams to collaborate and work on a codebase without an active connection to the centralized repository.
