# Welcome

This guide aims to progressively introduce various concepts necessary to start using Git to manage your project.&#x20;

## Using this guide

Before starting the guide, it is highly recommended that you give [setup.md](setup.md "mention")a read to ensure that everything you need for this guide is correctly setup.

We also highly recommend that you read [fundamentals-of-git.md](fundamental-concepts/fundamentals-of-git.md "mention") to understand the terminologies that this guide uses.

The guide is broken up into three parts:

1. Fundamental concepts
2. Collaborative workflows
3. Advanced concepts

The first two parts are the most important and we highly recommend that you, at the very least, finish them. The last part is good to know but not crucial if you are in a rush.

If you encounter a command with `<text>` format, you are to replace `<text>` with your own.
