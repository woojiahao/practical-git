# Welcome!

This guide aims to progressively introduce various concepts necessary to start using Git to manage your project. Before starting the guide, it is highly recommended that you give [setup.md](setup.md "mention")a read to ensure that everything you need for this guide is correctly setup.

This guide was created as an effort by [NUS Hackers](http://nushackers.org/) to make knowledge easily available for various technical topics!
